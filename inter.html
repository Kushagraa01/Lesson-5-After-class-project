                 <h2>Seasons</h2>
                 <p>Seasons are periods of the year with distinct weather conditions and day lengths.
                
                The four seasons — winter, spring, summer, autumn — can vary significantly in characteristics and can prompt changes in
                the world around them. Here, we explore the seasons of the year in more detail.
                
                Attributes of the seasons may vary by location, but there are still broad definitions that cross most of the boundaries.</p>
